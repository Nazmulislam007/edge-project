# Covid-19 Data Visualization

This project visualizes Covid-19 data using Python libraries such as `pandas` and `matplotlib`. The visualizations highlight trends in Covid-19 cases, including deaths, confirmed cases, recovered cases, and the relationship between deaths and confirmed cases.

## Features

- **Death Count**: Bar chart showing the number of deaths over time.
- **Confirmed Cases**: Line chart tracking confirmed cases over time.
- **Recovered Cases**: Scatter plot illustrating recovered cases over time.
- **Deaths vs Confirmed Cases**: Line plot comparing the number of deaths to confirmed cases.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nazmulislam007/edge-project/
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd edge-project
   ```
3. Ensure the CSV file (`covid_19_data.csv`) is in the project directory.
4. Run in Jupyter Notebook

## File Structure

- `covid_19_data.csv`: Dataset containing Covid-19 data.
- `19ACE007.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for visualizations.

## Output

The script generates four visualizations:

1. Bar chart of death counts.
2. Line chart of confirmed cases.
3. Scatter plot of recovered cases.
4. Line plot comparing deaths to confirmed cases.

## Example Visualizations

Example visualizations will be displayed when the script is executed.
